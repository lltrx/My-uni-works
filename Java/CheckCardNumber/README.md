## Check Card Number is a class that will check which type of card number you input is, such as Mastercard, Visa, American express and Unionpay.
## Also it checks the length of each type, for example, a visa card has a number length between 13 and 19.
## So the class will check if the card is one of the types above, the type length and return true if the card is valid.
